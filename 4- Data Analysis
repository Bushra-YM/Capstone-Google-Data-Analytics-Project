--Data Analysis

  
-- Bikes Types --
-- Determine the count of bike ride categories by the rider type, distinguishing between members or annual riders. Utilize the following code:


SELECT
  member_casual as Type_of_Rider,
  rideable_type as bike_type,
  COUNT(ride_id) AS Total_Num_of_Rides
FROM `bikes.combined_tripdata`
GROUP BY
  Type_of_Rider, bike_type;


--This code groups the bike rides based on the rider type (member or annual rider) and the bike type, providing the total number of rides for each combination.--




--------- Total Rides By Type ------------


--The code determines the total count of bike rides for each unique rideable type, offering insights into the distribution of rides across different types.


SELECT
  rideable_type,
  COUNT(rideable_type) AS Total_Rides
FROM
  `root-gist-408601.bikes.combined_tripdata`
GROUP BY
  rideable_type;




--------- No. of trips per month  ------------


SELECT month, member_casual, COUNT(ride_id) AS total_trips
FROM `root-gist-408601.bikes.cleaned_combined_data`
GROUP BY month, member_casual
ORDER BY member_casual, month ASC;


--------- No. of trips per week  ------------


SELECT day_of_week, member_casual, COUNT(ride_id) AS total_trips
FROM `root-gist-408601.bikes.cleaned_combined_data`
GROUP BY day_of_week, member_casual
ORDER BY member_casual, day_of_week;


--------- No. of trips per hour  ------------


SELECT EXTRACT(HOUR FROM started_at) AS hour_of_day, member_casual, COUNT(ride_id) AS total_trips
FROM `root-gist-408601.bikes.cleaned_combined_data`
GROUP BY hour_of_day, member_casual
ORDER BY member_casual, hour_of_day;




--------- Average Ride Length per hour ------------

FROM `root-gist-408601.bikes.cleaned_combined_data`
GROUP BY hour_of_day, member_casual;


--------- Average Ride length Per month ------------


SELECT month, member_casual, AVG(ride_length) AS avg_ride_duration
FROM `root-gist-408601.bikes.cleaned_combined_data`
GROUP BY month, member_casual;


--------- Average Ride length Per week ------------
