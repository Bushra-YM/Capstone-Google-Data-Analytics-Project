First, we'll merge the 12 monthly bike trip data tables into a unified table,
encompassing all bike trips occurring between January 1, 2021, and December 31, 2021. 
Following that, we'll extend this process to cover the months from January 2023 to December 2023.


CREATE TABLE `root-gist-408601.bikes.combined_tripdata` AS
SELECT * FROM `root-gist-408601.bikes.trip_data01`
UNION ALL
SELECT * FROM `root-gist-408601.bikes.trip_data02`
UNION ALL
SELECT * FROM `root-gist-408601.bikes.trip_data03`
UNION ALL
SELECT * FROM `root-gist-408601.bikes.trip_data04`
UNION ALL
SELECT * FROM `root-gist-408601.bikes.trip_data05`
UNION ALL
SELECT * FROM `root-gist-408601.bikes.trip_data06`
UNION ALL
SELECT * FROM `root-gist-408601.bikes.trip_data07`
UNION ALL
SELECT * FROM `root-gist-408601.bikes.trip_data08`
UNION ALL
SELECT * FROM `root-gist-408601.bikes.trip_data09`
UNION ALL
SELECT * FROM `root-gist-408601.bikes.trip_data10`
UNION ALL
SELECT * FROM `root-gist-408601.bikes.trip_data11`
UNION ALL
SELECT * FROM `root-gist-408601.bikes.trip_data12`;




-- To confirm, I ran the query 


'SELECT * FROM root-gist-408601.bikes.combined_tripdata'


and recorded a total count of 5,719,877 rows.
The difference from the combined sum of the 12 tables can be explained by the elimination of duplicate rows in the UNION operation.
In the context of using UNION ALL, it retains all rows from the specified tables, essentially appending them together. 
Consequently, the total row count in the combined table should match the sum of rows from the 12 individual tables.
